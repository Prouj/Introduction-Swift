Swift is a new programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. 
Nonetheless, many parts of Swift will be familiar from your experience of developing in C and Objective-C.
Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C types, including Int for integers, 
Double and Float for floating-point values, Bool for Boolean values, and String for textual data.
Swift also provides powerful versions of the three primary collection types, Array, Set, and Dictionary, 
as described in Collection Types.
Swift differs from other languages in that it is application-oriented, making it much more effective than
other languages like ojective-C or Python.
Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:

Variables are always initialized before use.
Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
Integers are checked for overflow.
Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
Memory is managed automatically.
Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.

A type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with.
If part of your code requires a String, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake.
Likewise, type safety prevents you from accidentally passing an optional String to a piece of code that 
requires a non-optional String. Type safety helps you catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.

377
If you donâ€™t specify the type of value you need, Swift uses type inference to work out the appropriate type.
Type inference enables a compiler to deduce the type of a particular expression automatically when it
compiles your code, simply by examining the values you provide.
